###NAME  


Wc - calculates average sentence length from sentences in raw text file
 
###SYNOPSIS  


java Wc [filepath_filename] [flags]  
OR  
java Wc [flags] [filepath_filename]

###DESCRIPTION  


For each operand that specifies a default_delimiter and default_min_word_length, the "java wc" command executes the program 'wc' from the command line and returns a result indicating the average word length in a sentence to the user.  


If no operand is specified for the default_delimiter, then the default delimiters 
used to identify the end of sentences will be ".:;!?" If no operand are specified for the default_min_word_length, 
then 4 characters will be used.

###OPTIONS  

**-d**  
Flag used to identify the delimiters to use indicate the end of a sentence.  
Example:  -d<sequence_of_characters>  --- there should not be a space between the flag and the value  
>	     -d;/?-  
>	     delimiters may appear in any order  
>	     delimiters may only be single characters  
	    
**-l**  
Flag to identify the minimum word length 
Any value may be including a value of zero (0), there should not be a space between the flag and the value  
*Example:*  -l3
	     
	     
Example when specifying both delimiter and minimum word length flags:  
>	java wc -l4 -d./;:! [filepath_filename]
