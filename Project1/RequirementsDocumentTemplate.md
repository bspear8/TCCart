# **Requirements Document -- Team 38**

The purpose of this project is to create an application for Lauren and her students which will help perfect the students' writing skills.  Currently, students often write essays utilizing long, wordy sentences.  The application will count the number of words per sentence within an essay.  The students will have the opportunity to make adjustments to their essay and run the application again until they are satisfied with the results of their sentence lengths.
