# **Project Plan -- Team 38**

##1 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create an application for Lauren and her students which will help perfect the students' writing skills.  Currently, students often write essays utilizing long, wordy sentences.  The application will count the number of words per sentence within an essay.  The students will have the opportunity to make adjustments to their essay and run the application again until they are satisfied with the results of their sentence lengths.

##2 Process Description

Requirements Anaylsis:
-----------------------
-Desc: All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document.

-Entrance Criteria: Customer input via interview will be used for this process.

-Exit Critera: Full set of requirements mapped out with a requirements document completed.

System Design:
--------------
-Desc: The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and system design is prepared. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture.

-Entrance Criteria: Finished requirements document and project plan will allow the development lead to determine structure   and layout of the program.

-Exit Criteria: A written description of the planned system design.

Implementation:
---------------
-Desc: The majority of coding is done in this phase. Small units of code will be constructed and then tested.  

-Entrance Criteria: The design documents are finalized.  

-Exit Criteria: All units of code are written and testing is complete.  

Integration:
------------
-Desc: The units of code are integrated into a single product and then the product as a whole is tested.  

-Entrance Critera: All units of code are written and testing is complete.  

-Exit Criteria: The product is integrated and is fully functional with no known errors.  

Deployment:
----------
-Desc: The product is released to the customer. In this case, the product github commit code is submitted to tsquare by the project manager.  

-Entrance Critera: The product is integrated and is fully functional with no known errors.  

-Exit Criteria: Successful project submission.  

Maintenance:
-----------
-Desc: This process phase is purely notional for the purposes of this project. Post release the team would normally support the code for a specified length of time, fixing any newly discovered errors or modifying the project to meet new             customer needs.  

-Entrance Criteria: This phase begins immediately following product release.  

-Exit Criteria: After pre-agreed upon period of time has expired or the product is no longer used by the customer.
