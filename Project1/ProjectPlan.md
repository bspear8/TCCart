# **Project Plan -- Team 38**

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of the Average Sentence Length project is to create an application for Lauren and her students to help improve their writing skills. The application will calculate the average number of words per sentence within an essay.  The students will have the opportunity to make adjustments to their essay and run the application again until they are satisfied with the results of their sentence lengths. We will use the Waterfall methodology to develop this application.

## 2 Process Description

### Analyze Requirements:

###### Description
Capture all possible requirements for the Average Sentence Length project in a requirements specification document.

###### Entrance Criteria
Customer input from the initial interview will be considered. Additionally, we will ask the customer questions during the asynchronous office hours, and the answers to these questsions will be considered.

###### Exit Critera
Full set of requirements mapped out in a complete requirements specification document.

### Design System:

###### Description 
The requirement specifications are studied in this phase and a system design is prepared. System Design helps in specifying hardware and software requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture.

###### Entrance Criteria
Finished requirements document and project plan will allow the development lead to determine structure and layout of the program.

###### Exit Criteria
A written description of the planned system design.

### Implement code

###### Description
The code is written during this phase. Small units of code will be constructed and then tested.  

###### Entrance Criteria: 
The design documents are finalized.  

###### Exit Criteria 
All units of code are written and testing is complete.  

### Integrate

###### Description 
The units of code are integrated into a single product and then the product as a whole is tested.  

###### Entrance Critera
All units of code are written and testing is complete.  

###### Exit Criteria
The product is integrated and is fully functional with no known errors.  

### Deploy Code

###### Description

The product is released to the customer. In this case, the product github commit code is submitted to tsquare by the project manager.  

###### Entrance Critera

The product is integrated and is fully functional with no known errors.  

###### Exit Criteria 

Successful project submission.  

### Maintain Software

###### Description

This process phase is purely notional for the purposes of this project. Post release the team would normally support the code for a specified length of time, fixing any newly discovered errors or modifying the project to meet new customer needs.  

###### Entrance Criteria

This phase begins immediately following product release.  

###### Exit Criteria

After pre-agreed upon period of time has expired or the product is no longer used by the customer.
